# `gc` module

`use gc::{root, weak, upgrade, collect, heap_bytes};` — explicit GC pins, weak handles, heap stats, and manual collection via HostInvoke.

| Surface | Types | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `Root<T>` | opaque type ctor | Strong pin; keeps `T` alive while the handle is reachable |
| `Weak<T>` | opaque type ctor | Non-rooting handle; does not keep `T` alive |
| `root` | `T -> Root<T>` | Allocate a pin around a value |
| `get` | `Root<T> -> T` | Read the pinned value; pin remains valid |
| `unroot` | `Root<T> -> T` | Take the value and clear the pin |
| `weak` | `T -> Weak<T>` | Allocate a non-rooting handle |
| `upgrade` | `Weak<T> -> Option<T>` | `Some` while the referent is live; `None` after collection |
| `heap_bytes` | `() -> int` | Managed heap size in bytes (`Heap::size`) |
| `collect` | `() -> int` | Force a full mark-sweep; returns bytes freed |

## Semantics

- **`Root`** participates in mark-sweep: while a `Root` object is reachable from VM roots, its payload is marked.
- **`unroot`** clears the pin so a still-reachable `Root` shell no longer keeps the payload alive.
- **`Weak`** is not traced as a strong reference. After mark, class finalizers run (and can still `upgrade` a weak to the instance being dropped); then a re-mark from VM roots; then weaks whose heap referents are still unmarked are cleared before sweep.
- **Immediates** (`int`, `bool`, …) under `Weak` always upgrade successfully (they are not heap objects).
- **`Root` / `Weak` are not thread-sendable.**
- **`heap_bytes`** reports VM-managed heap accounting only — not process RSS (native libs, stacks, Rust allocators sit outside it).
- **`collect`** roots the operand stack and suspended coroutines the same way automatic GC does.
- **Class `fn drop()`** runs after mark on unmarked instances with a registered finalizer, then a re-mark from VM roots, then weaks are cleared and sweep runs. Drop runs at most once (including explicit `obj.drop()`). Nested `collect` during drop is deferred. A panic in drop aborts that finalizer and continues the queue. After `main` returns, remaining finalizers run before the IO reactor shuts down (and again from `Machine` drop if anything is still pending).
- **Named locals are heap instances ([COI-84](https://linear.app/ardax/issue/COI-84)).** `new Class(args).field` may skip the box (no identity); `let p = new Class(args)` always `InitTyped`s. Classes with `fn drop()` always allocate, including consumed temps.
- **Resurrection is defined, not an API ([COI-79](https://linear.app/ardax/issue/COI-79)).** Storing `self` (or a field that aliases it) into a static, a still-reachable object, or a `Root` during `fn drop()` keeps the instance alive after the sweep — the post-drop re-mark sees that store. Drop still will not run again: the instance’s `finalized` bit stays set. Prefer `root` / `Weak` when you need an intentional lifetime pin; do not rely on drop-time stores.

Typical FFI pattern: `root` a Coil buffer/callback before handing its address to C; hold `Weak` entries in Coil-side registries so maps do not extend lifetimes. Use `fn drop()` to close the native handle when the wrapper becomes unreachable.

```coil
use gc::{collect, get, root, unroot, upgrade, weak};
use io::{stdout};
use io::sync::{write_all};
use string::{to_bytes};

fn ephemeral_weak() {
    let r = root([1, 2, 3]);
    let w = weak(get(r));
    let dropped = unroot(r);
    dropped = [];
    return w;
}

fn main() {
    let w = ephemeral_weak();
    collect();
    let label = match upgrade(w) {
        Option::Some(_) => "some",
        Option::None => "none",
    };
    write_all(stdout(), to_bytes(label));
}
```

Drop all strong refs (including frame locals / operand temps that still name the
value) before `collect`, or return only the `Weak` from a helper as above.
