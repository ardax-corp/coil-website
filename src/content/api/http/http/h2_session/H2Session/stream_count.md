- [`H2Session::open`](/packages/http/reference/http/h2_session/H2Session/open): A session for `role` (1 client, 0 server); `preface_done` 1 skips waiting for the client preface.
- [`H2Session::new`](/packages/http/reference/http/h2_session/H2Session/new): A server session, expecting the client connection preface first.
- [`H2Session::client`](/packages/http/reference/http/h2_session/H2Session/client): A client session: the peer sends no connection preface.
- [`H2Session::find_id`](/packages/http/reference/http/h2_session/H2Session/find_id): The internal index of stream `sid`, or 999999 when the session has no such stream.
- [`H2Session::queue_frame`](/packages/http/reference/http/h2_session/H2Session/queue_frame): Queues frame `f` for `drain`.
- [`H2Session::queue_bytes`](/packages/http/reference/http/h2_session/H2Session/queue_bytes): Queues raw bytes for `drain`.
- [`H2Session::fail_conn`](/packages/http/reference/http/h2_session/H2Session/fail_conn): Queues GOAWAY with `code` (once) and returns `Protocol`: a connection error.
